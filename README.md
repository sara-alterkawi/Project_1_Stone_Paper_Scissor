# 🎮 Stone-Paper-Scissors Game

🎯 **About the Project**

A **fun and interactive command-line game** where the player competes against the computer in the classic **Stone, Paper, Scissors** game.

**How the game works:**

* The player chooses one of the three options: **Stone (✊), Paper (🖐), or Scissors (✌️)**.
* The computer randomly selects its choice.
* The game compares both choices:

  * **Stone beats Scissors** (Stone crushes Scissors)
  * **Scissors beats Paper** (Scissors cut Paper)
  * **Paper beats Stone** (Paper covers Stone)
  * If both choose the same option, it’s a **draw**.
* The winner of each round is displayed immediately.

**Key programming concepts practiced:**

* 🟢 Conditional statements
* 🔄 Loops
* 🎲 Random number generation
* ⚙️ Functions

This project is part of the **AbouHadhood Platform training track** with Dr. Mohamed Abou Hadhoud.
